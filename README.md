# CSS-Animations
- [x] <b>About:</b>
  - CSS Animations refer to a technique used in web development to animate elements on a webpage using CSS (Cascading 
    Style Sheets). With CSS Animations, developers can create dynamic effects and transitions without relying on 
    JavaScript or other scripting languages.
- [x] <b>Effects:</b>
  - CSS Animation effects refer to the various visual effects and transitions that can be achieved using CSS animations. 
   These effects can range from simple transitions like fading in/out or sliding elements, to more complex animations 
   like rotating, scaling, and bouncing elements. CSS Animation effects can add interactivity and visual appeal to 
   websites and web applications without the need for JavaScript.
   Here are some common CSS Animation effects:
     - Fade In/Out: Elements gradually appear or disappear by animating their opacity.
     - Slide: Elements move smoothly in a specified direction, such as sliding in from the top, bottom, left, or right.
     - Rotate: Elements rotate around a specified axis or point.
     - Scale: Elements grow or shrink in size.
     - Bounce: Elements mimic a bouncing motion, where they scale up and down slightly as they move.
     - Spin: Elements continuously rotate around a specified axis.
     - Color Change: Elements change their background or text color over time.
     - Pulse: Elements increase and decrease in size rhythmically, creating a pulsating effect.
     - Flip: Elements flip over around a specified axis.
     - Blur: Elements gradually become blurred or unblurred.
     - Shake: Elements move rapidly back and forth, simulating a shaking motion.
     - Parallax: Background images or elements move at a different speed than the foreground elements, creating a sense 
       of depth.

  These effects can be combined, customized, and triggered in various ways to create engaging and interactive user 
  experiences. CSS Animation effects are widely used in modern web development to enhance the visual appeal and usability 
  of websites and web applications.
